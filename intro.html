				<p>One great gift of the Second Vatican Council for Catholic Christians has been the invitation to allow the Word of God to become the companion on our journey, to become the source of nourishment, the very means by which we establish, renew and deepen our relationship with Jesus Christ. The apostolic exhortation, Verbum Domini, recognised, that a 'more prayerful and spiritual reading of scripture will enhance our appreciation of the Bible and our participation in the Church's liturgical life' (#86).</p>
				<p>In the early part of 2014 we were reminded by the scarcity of rain and the severity of the heat and bushfires that we live in a 'sunburnt country' withering away into desert. Nonetheless, we maintain hope in the midst of tragedies and move forward with confidence. Pope Francis, too, has been a source of inspiration for many with the freshness he brings through his example and in his words, to the understanding of faith, frequently inviting us to be people of hope.</p>
				<p>Hope &ndash; this is a virtue well worth keeping in mind as we journey yet again through the weeks of Lent with God's Word as our guiding light.</p>
				<p>The reality of Easter and its inherent promise reminds us once more that we are a people characterised by hope. It is in our very blood as Followers of Christ. Born as a priestly people through our baptism we hold hope as a virtue that supports and informs our life in faith.</p>
				<p>We begin our Lenten journey, a time of letting go, a time in the desert, as our weekly lectio reminds us, ending in the apparent hopelessness of Good Friday, then the culmination of our baptismal promise in the ultimate hope of Christ's resurrection.</p>
				<p>We believe the Christian story does not end on Good Friday. Sunday is 'a coming!' And our daily encounter with the Word of God through our Lenten lectio deepens this conviction and affords us hope in the midst of darkness, and reminds us that there is a reality greater than those shadows in which we can anchor our soul.</p>
				<p>May the time given to your Lenten lectio renew your faith in this incredible story and deepen your relationship with the Risen Lord into whose life you have been reborn.</p>
