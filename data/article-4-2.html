			<h1 class="deco">Isaiah 50:4-7</h1>
			<p><sup>4</sup>The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of a teacher, that I may know how to sustain the weary with a word. Morning by morning he wakens - wakens my ear to listen as those who are taught. <sup>5</sup>The Lord GOD has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, I did not turn backward. <sup>6</sup>I gave my back to those who struck me, and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard; I did not hide my face from insult and spitting. <sup>7</sup>The Lord GOD helps me; therefore I have not been disgraced; therefore I have set my face like flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame.</p>
