			<h1 class="deco">Good Friday</h1>
			<p>At a retreat, the leader asked the participants to think of someone who represented Christ in their lives. When it came time to share answers, one woman replied, "I had to think hard about that one. I kept thinking, <i>Who is it who told the truth about myself so clearly that I wanted to kill him for it?"</i></p>
			<p>According to John's account of  the passion, Jesus died because he told the truth to everyone he met. He was  the truth, the perfect mirror in which people saw themselves in God's own	light.</p>
			<p>On this Good Friday, that mirror is held up to our own faces and lives. In the presence of Jesus' integrity, our own pretence is exposed. In the presence of his constancy, our cowardice is brought to light. In the presence of his fierce love for God and for us, our own hardness of heart is revealed. </p>
			<p>On this Good Friday, we stand at the foot of the cross, and if we stand there long enough and thoughtfully enough, the cross becomes a mirror in which we see ourselves in all our imperfections and inconsistencies; we confront in the reflection of the cross not what we say we believe but what really believe, the values we actually live and that propel our lives.</p>
			<p>But in Jesus' cross we also begin to see the transforming and healing presence of love in our lives. Jesus' death is love most complete and humble, love that is unconditional and joyfully offered. </p>
			<p>Do not turn away from the cross. Make yourself look in the mirror. </p>
			<p>See the injustice, the cowardice, the failure that nails Jesus to his cross and leads to the countless crucifixions that take place in our world every day. And once you see and understand and accept, you are ready to embrace and be embraced in the hope of tomorrow night.<br>[Adapted from "The Perfect Mirror" by Barbara Brown Taylor, <b>The Christian Century</b>, March 18-25, 1998.]</p>
			<p><i>Today we stand at the foot of your cross, O Christ. Open our hearts and spirits to see ourselves in your cross and confront the hard truths of our lives in the here-and-now and the redeeming truths of your life in us. By this sacred tree may we be re-born in your compassion and forgiveness; may it always be a living sign for us of what you have called us to be; may it be the perfect symbol for us of how to live the lives our baptisms compel us to live.</i></p>
