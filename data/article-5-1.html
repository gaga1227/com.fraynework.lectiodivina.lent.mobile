			<p>When the young woman volunteered to become a foster mother, she knew that the children she would take in would eventually move on. Still, that didn't stop her from growing fond of a three-year old girl who came to stay with her. As time passed, the little girl became attached to an old stuffed rabbit that the woman had since she was a girl. The rabbit became the child's most cherished toy.</p>
			<p>After two years, the day came when the little girl was to be adopted by a new family. Though she knew that this would open up worlds of opportunity for the child, the woman still found it hard to say goodbye to the vivacious youngster she would probably never see again. As they said their final goodbyes, she gave the youngster a special present - the stuffed rabbit she loved so much. "This is for you to remember me by."</p>
			<p>The overjoyed child hugged her and the toy. Then, quite suddenly, the little girl ran to her bedroom one last time. The girl returned with a stuffed animal of her own. "Here," the little girl said. "This is so you won't forget me either."</p>
			<p>That stuffed animal, the foster mother later said, was the best present anyone ever gave her.<br />[Adapted from "Never underestimate the love of a child" by Alicia Swartz, cyberstory.com.]</p>
			<p>What binds us together as families, as friends, and as a church, are the memories we share. Like the two stuffed animals exchanged by the foster mother and her young ward, the Word of God we hear and sing and pray and the bread we bless and break and share are the living memory of the great Paschal event of Christ.</p>
			<p>In the bread and wine of the Eucharist, in our imitating his simple but eloquent act of washing the feet of our brothers and sisters, we become the story we remember. Our remembering Jesus at this table as he instructed is not just a faded picture in a photograph album or a forgotten memento on a shelf but a living reality - the Christ of the Gospel lives among us in our love for one another; the Risen One continues to walk among us in every act of forgiveness and generosity. This night challenges us to make the memory of Jesus' healing and humble love for all humanity live again in our own acts of healing forgiveness and compassionate generosity.</p>
			<p><i>Gracious Father, tonight we remember the beginning of Jesus' "passover." Help us to be faithful to his memory: to remember his life and love among us: As we receive this night the bread and wine of the Eucharist, may we become Christ's body and blood for our broken,
hurting world; as he washes the feet of his disciples as his last lesson in selfless love, may we become joyful and generous foot washers of all your children who come to this table with us.</i></p>
