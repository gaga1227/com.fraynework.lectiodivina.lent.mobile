			<p>Nine-year-old David decides to give up his favourite sweets for Lent - M&Ms. He's good for a bag a day, so 40 bags, rounded out to one dollar a bag, comes to $40 over Lent. Plus Mum and Dad offer to match his Lenten sacrifice, dollar for dollar. So, on Easter Sunday, David's Lenten discipline results in $80. Now: What to do with the money?</p>
			<p>In school David learns about a Church agency that drills water wells in poor African countries. Done! David gives his $80 to the organisation. He receives a letter of thanks - and David is now on their mailing list. Every few weeks, David receives a newsletter about new projects made possible by donations like his $80.</p>
			<p>That $80 was earned several Lents ago. But David still supports the program and many others like it. The Lenten sacrifice of his childhood instilled in the now-adult David a deep, permanent sense of compassion and empathy.</p>
			<p>David's Lenten sacrifice of M & Ms is a model of Lenten conversion. Lent calls us to sacrifice and penance - but not out of self-loathing or false humility. Lent is the season to "turn" away - the word <i>conversion</i> means "to turn" - from our own needs and wants in order to see a world bigger than ourselves, a world in which the Spirit of God lives and moves, and a world the Spirit of God calls us to transform and re-create in the love of God. David's "sacrifice" leads him to a new appreciation for what he has and opens his heart to the needs of others; his "turning" results in a life-long "turning" to generosity and empathy.</p>
			<p>How might we take on that kind of sacrifice this Lent? Over the next forty days, let's find a way to give up something - money, time, attitudes - that has the potential to result in a new perspective that will last well beyond Easter Sunday. "Turn" this Lent - "turn" away from a self-centred view of the world and toward a Christ-centred perspective that enables each one of us to re-create our homes and hearts in the life of Easter.</p>
			<p><i>God of mercy and compassion, be with us on the journey to Easter that we begin today. Open our hearts to hear your call to holy sacrifice, that these days may be a time for healing and restoration that leads to a permanent change of heart, a transformation of our perspectives and attitudes.</i></p>
			<p><i>Help us to find within ourselves your grace, that we may transform our lives and our world from the ashes of division and selfishness to the peace and hope of Easter.</i></p>
