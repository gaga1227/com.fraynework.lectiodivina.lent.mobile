			<p><sup>6</sup>Though he was in the form of God,<br>
			did not regard equality with God<br>
			as something to be exploited,<br>
			<sup>7</sup>but emptied himself,<br>
			taking the form of a slave,<br>
			being born in human likeness.<br>
			And being found in human form,<br>
			<sup>8</sup>he humbled himself<br>
			and became obedient to the point of death-<br>
			even death on a cross.</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>Therefore God also highly exalted him<br>
			and gave him the name<br>
			that is above every name,<br>
			<sup>10</sup>so that at the name of Jesus<br>
			every knee should bend,<br>
			in heaven and on earth and under the earth,<br>
			<sup>11</sup>and every tongue should confess<br>
			that Jesus Christ is Lord,<br>
			to the glory of God the Father.</p>
