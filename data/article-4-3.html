			<p>Though he was in the form of God,<br />
			did not regard equality with God<br />
			as something to be exploited,<br />
			but emptied himself,<br />
			taking the form of a slave,<br />
			being born in human likeness.<br />
			And being found in human form,<br />
			he humbled himself<br />
			and became obedient to the point of death-<br />
			even death on a cross.</p>
			<p>Therefore God also highly exalted him<br />
			and gave him the name<br />
			that is above every name,<br />
			so that at the name of Jesus<br />
			every knee should bend,<br />
			in heaven and on earth and under the earth,<br />
			and every tongue should confess<br />
			that Jesus Christ is Lord,<br />
			to the glory of God the Father.</p>
