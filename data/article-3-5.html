			<p>As we look to the future, to Easter when we celebrate the death, burial and resurrection of Christ, we also look to the past, to the death of another who too was risen. We look to the death of Lazarus.</p>
			<p>Jesus and his disciples had left Galilee to stay out of the way of the religious leaders who had plotted to kill Jesus. They were on their way back to Jerusalem to the Cross when news came to them of Lazarus being ill. Jesus did not immediately set off for Bethany where Lazarus lived with his sisters Mary and Martha. Jesus waited for two days. Why? So that Lazarus would die, so that when Lazarus was risen from the dead the disciples of Jesus would believe.</p>
			<p>Today's Gospel is very much about belief. Martha and Mary both believed that if Jesus had arrived before Lazarus had died, Jesus would have healed him and Lazarus would have lived. When they first encountered Jesus at different times each said, "Lord, if you had been here my brother would have lived." That statement was both a profession of faith and an accusation of not being present when needed.</p>
			<p>In answer to that statement by Martha, Jesus tested Martha's faith. Jesus pronounced, "I am the resurrection and the life, those who believe in me though they die will live, and everyone who believes in me will never die." What a statement! In answer to the question Jesus put to Martha, "Do you believe?" Martha responds, "Yes Lord I believe. I know that you are the Messiah, the Son of God." But what is it that Martha believes? When Jesus commands that the stone be rolled away from the tomb, Martha urges caution because Lazarus had been dead four days. His Spirit has left. His body has started to decay and there would be a smell. It seems that Martha's profession of faith, as wonderful as it is, had limitations.</p>
			<p>When Mary tells Jesus that Lazarus would not have died had Jesus arrived earlier, Jesus does not engage in conversation with her at all. He sees how upset she is and is "greatly disturbed in spirit and deeply moved." He begins to weep. Why? He knows that God will raise Lazarus from the dead. He knows that his friend Lazarus will live. Why does he weep? Is it because of the lack of faith of Mary, one of his closest friends?</p>
			<p>When Lazarus is raised we are told that those who witnessed the miracle believed. What did they believe? The authorities hearing of the event plot even harder to kill Jesus and Lazarus as well. Thomas prophesied that in returning to Bethany Jesus would seal his fate and die, and he did. Within a few days of raising Lazarus, Jesus died on the Cross. Jesus gave his life for the life of Lazarus, just as Jesus gave his life for each one of us.</p>
			<p>This is powerful Gospel with many layers and great subtlety. What do we believe? Do the words spoken by Jesus to Martha ring in our ears, do they reverberate in our soul, "I am the resurrection and the life, those who believe in me though they die will live, and everyone who believes in me will never die." If they don't, why not? What do we believe?</p>
