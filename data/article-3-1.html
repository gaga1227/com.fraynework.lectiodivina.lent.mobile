			<p>Some years ago many witnessed an extraordinary race. It was during games for people with disabilities. The race was a running race. One runner ran alone. His coach spoke into a megaphone saying one, one, one, or two, two, two or three, three, three. One, one, one, meant that the runner was running in the correct lane. Two, two, two meant he was veering left and three, three, three that he was veering right. The crowd was eerily silent. The runner was blind. Yet he ran at full pace into the darkness, guided by the voice of his trainer, trusting his trainer to lead him along the correct lane. When the runner crossed the lane, the crowd erupted into cheering and applause. What courage, what faith, what a race.</p>
			<p>In today's Gospel Jesus heals a man who has been blind from birth. He heals him on the Sabbath. When challenged by the authorities the man first tells them how Jesus healed him, then identifies Jesus as a prophet, then praises Jesus as coming from God. The man is driven out of the Temple by the priests because they saw but did not believe, because the man made them feel uncomfortable, because Jesus made them feel inadequate. Knowing that the man had been driven out, Jesus sought him out and the man came to realise that Jesus is the Son of the Living God. The man worshipped Jesus praying, "Lord, I believe."</p>
			<p>The Pharisees criticised Jesus for healing on the Sabbath, saying he could not be from God because he broke the Law of Moses in doing so. In our 1<sup>st</sup> Reading Samuel anointed the youngest of eight brothers, a mere boy, because God does not see things as we do. God saw in the boy the qualities needed to lead the tribe of Israel. The boy's name was David who became the greatest of the Jewish kings. Others saw David as a boy. They had eyes but did not see. Jesus responded to the criticism of the Pharisees by noting that they too had eyes but chose not to see the ways of God.</p>
			<p>In our 2<sup>nd</sup> reading Paul tells us to live as children of the Light and that Christ will shine on us. It is difficult to see in the dark. For some darkness is all they know. Jesus is the light of the world, lighting our path, guiding us. The voice of Jesus is like the trainer guiding the runner. The one, one, one spoken by Jesus is all we need to live in the light. As we prepare for the great miracle of Easter, let us turn our faces to the light of Christ. Like the runner let us be guided by the voice of our Lord. Like the blind man, let us see the way of God and profess, "Lord, I believe."</p>
