			<p>Several years ago, the Italian film maker, Franco Zeffirelli offered the public his cinematic version of the good news of Jesus of Nazareth. In the film, after the crucifixion of Jesus on Calvary and his hasty burial, a member of the Sanhedrin was informed that certain followers of the itinerant teacher and healer were claiming that his tomb had been found empty. Others were spreading the news that they had experienced his risen presence. At that, the Jewish official moaned softly and sighed almost inaudibly, "&hellip; and so it begins." And so indeed, the resurrection of Jesus marked the beginning of a new way of life centred in Christ Jesus, who died but now lives forever. By virtue of Jesus' victory over sin and death, believers are offered a new perspective. Jesus' cross and resurrection changed forever the way we look at death; it changed the way we look at life, at this world and at one another.</p>
			<p>As the late Karl Rahner once explained, Jesus' resurrection gives meaning to the Holy Saturday of human existence. "A strange, mysterious, silent day, a day without a liturgy, Holy Saturday is a symbol of everyday life which is a mean between the abysmal terror of Good Friday and the exuberant joy of Easter. For ordinary life is also mostly in between the two; the Holy Saturday of our life must be the preparation for Easter, the persistent hope for the final glory of God."<sup>2</sup></p>
			<p>To live the Holy Saturday of this life worthily, Rahner suggested, is to live in hope, doing what is possible and expecting God to do the impossible. It is to recognise the truth of the words of Tertullian (145-220 C.E.), namely, <i>Caro cardo salutis</i>, or the flesh is the hinge of salvation. The reality of Easter is that God is not simply up yonder or the totally other transcendent one. He has come to us, in the flesh and blood of human existence and therein has transformed who we are. "Since then, Mother earth has only borne children who are transformed. For Jesus' resurrection is the beginning of the resurrection of all flesh."<sup>3</sup></p>
			<p>Another perspective on the resurrection was proposed centuries ago by Augustine (354-430 C.E.). "Give me a lover", said the bishop of Hippo, "and he will understand the resurrection." Expanding on Augustine's thought, Gerald O'Collins  explained that the love between a man and a woman hints at the divine love revealed in the resurrection. "For God the Father to say, 'This is the Son whom I love' (see Mark 1:11, 9:7) was to say 'He will not die', or rather, 'I will not abandon him to death' (Acts 2:25-31). The fourth evangelist used similar love-language in his telling of Jesus' passion, death and resurrection: "Before the feast of Passover, Jesus knew that his hour had come to pass from this world to the Father. He loved his own in the world and he loved them to the end." (John 13:1) Love is not confined by the limitations of time or death. Parents do not tell their children, we shall love you for 10, 15 or 20 years. Children do not say, "I shall forget you when you die." Lovers do not say, "I will love you for five years." "Genuine love is committed and committing to the language of 'forever'." (Gerald O'Collins, op. cit.).</p>
			<p>In Jesus' resurrection, the loved children of the Father are promised that his forever love will travel with them to life beyond the grave. In the risen Lord, believers find a new perspective of hope and meaning with which to view the Holy Saturday of human existence. Jesus, who was dead and is now risen assures us of the saving transformation of all flesh. With every Easter celebration we are privileged to affirm again: "&hellip; and so it begins&hellip;"</p>
