			<p>Had you been pressed into suggesting a symbol of the salvation wrought for all of humankind through the death and rising of Jesus, would the Cross have been on your short list. Probably not! Perhaps a dove, flying upward to the sky, untethered and free to soar&hellip; ? Perhaps a flower in full bloom&hellip; ? Perhaps a boat moored safely in a serene harbour after a long and treacherous journey&hellip; ? Perhaps a door opened wide with welcome&hellip; ? But a Cross?</p>
			<p>Every year during this sacred week, the Church invites us to consider once again, the meaning of the Cross. With each passing year we are to bring to our considerations an understanding and acceptance proportionate to the depth and growth of our faith during the year which has passed. What each of us brings this year is known only to ourselves and to the one who has given us the mystery of his Cross to consider.</p>
			<p>Found in both pre-Christian and non-Christian cultures where it has a cosmic or natural significance, the two crossed lines of unequal length symbolise the four dimensions of the universe. In both primitive and advanced civilisations and in places as widespread as India and Peru, the cross was regarded as a sign of power, and regeneration. "These natural, cosmic significations of the cross are not abrogated but rather deepened and purified by the development of Christian symbolism."<sup>2</sup></p>
			<p>Until the fifth century C.E., the early Christians generally avoided representing the Cross with the body of Jesus; in fact even bare crosses were rarely depicted until the fourth century C.E. As J. H. Miller (op. cit.) explained, there were many reasons for the Church's reluctance to openly represent the cross as its symbol. For many Jews and gentiles, the cross underscored the seemingly irreconcilable contradiction of Christian belief, namely, that a crucified man could also be God. As various early heresies attacked either the divinity or humanity of Christ, the symbol of the cross, which seemed to exacerbate the conflict, was avoided. Ironically, the oldest known representation of the crucified Christ is a graffiti which a pagan artist scratched on one of the Roman Palatine buildings: this blasphemous second century C.E. cartoon depicted a man with an ass's head on a cross, while another man stands in adoration. The caption, "Alexamenos worships his god", is still legible. Not until the fourth century,(during the reign of Constantine, did the cross begin to appear everywhere in public places as the pre-eminent symbol of Christianity. Despite the frequency of its representation in Christian art and architecture, the cross remains an ambivalent symbol. In its crossbeams meet death and life, sin and salvation, conquest and victory, immanence and transcendence. The cross represents both the basest aspects of the human condition and the most sublime reflection of divinity.</p>
			<p>As Karl Rahner once explained, "the cross of the Lord is the revelation of what sin really is. The cross of Christ mercilessly reveals what the world hides from itself: that it, as it were, devours the Son of God in the insane blindness of its sin -- a sin which Godless hate is truly set on fire upon contact with the love of God"<sup>3</sup>.</p>
			<p>As we consider the Cross, we see the truth, of who we are without God juxtaposed with the love of him who: (1) sent his only Son so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but might have eternal life (John 3:16); (2) showed his love for us in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us (Romans 5:8); (3) was lifted up so as to draw all people to himself (John 12:32).</p>
			<p>As the dual revelation of the sinfulness of humanity and the love of God, the cross is unparalleled. To accept Jesus' challenge "to take up our cross daily and follow him" (Luke 9:23) involves a simultaneous acknowledgement of our desperate need for salvation and a celebration of his loving overtures to the sinful. Consider the cross&hellip; it is at once sin and love bound together by the contradiction that in his death there is life; in his seeming failure there is triumph, and what appeared to be the end of one man's journey is but the beginning of the universal homecoming of humanity.</p>
