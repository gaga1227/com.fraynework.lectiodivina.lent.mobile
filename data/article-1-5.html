			<h1 class="deco">1<sup>st</sup> Sunday of Lent</h1>
			<p>We commenced Lent a few days ago with Ash Wednesday and our being signed with ashes. There have been hot cross buns and Easter eggs in the shops since the beginning of the New Year. All signal that our Lenten journey has commenced - but what is it all about - saying an extra prayer, attending an extra Mass, popping my loose change from my coffee in the Project Compassion box, or giving up biscuits at morning tea?</p>
			<p>Lent is so much more than this. While these are important and have their place, surely Lent is about coming to know the person of Jesus, and building our relationship with him culminating with what he did especially in those days from Holy Thursday, through Good Friday to  Easter Sunday. And the scripture readings assigned for this Sunday assist us to deepen this relationship. </p>
			<p>We know that Jesus was both human and divine, but this week we really see the human side of Jesus. Jesus is in the desert for forty days - this is an obvious link to our forty days of our Lenten journey. The readings are about temptation and choices. We see Jesus facing temptation on a number of occasions. He has to make a choice. It seems that Jesus has a relationship with God the Father that enables him to make the correct choice. Our lives are full of temptations, especially in our secular world of instant gratification. We are faced with temptations all the time and with choices, but if we spend some time to pray, hopefully we will make the correct choice.</p>
			<p>It is also interesting to note that Matthew uses on more occasions 'It is written'. I wonder if this can be interpreted that we should read the Bible more?</p>
			<p>Hopefully over the coming weeks, we can find a few minutes each day to read a little Scripture, possibly re-reading our scripture from Sunday, and also praying a little more.  I hope this can bring you to a greater understanding of the person of Jesus and to deepen your relationship with him.</p>
			<p>Surely Lent is good opportunity to do this!</p>
